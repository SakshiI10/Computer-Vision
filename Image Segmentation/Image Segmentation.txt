Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions based on certain criteria. 
The goal of segmentation is to group together pixels with similar properties, such as color, intensity, texture, or spatial proximity, while separating them from the rest of the image. 
This process is essential for various computer vision applications, including object detection, image understanding, medical image analysis, and scene interpretation. Here's an overview of image segmentation:
Types of Image Segmentation:
a) Thresholding
b) Contours
c) CNN
