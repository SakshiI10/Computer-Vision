CNN:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep neural network architecture specifically designed for image processing tasks.
They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for spatial reduction. 
CNNs have become a cornerstone in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation.
Key concepts and components of CNNs include:
Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional operations to input images, extracting spatial features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample feature maps, reducing spatial dimensions while preserving important features.
Fully Connected Layers: These layers perform classification or regression tasks based on the extracted features.
Activation Functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh): Introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs.
Training Techniques: CNNs are typically trained using optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants, along with techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation.
