Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
In the context of computer vision, machine learning algorithms are often used for tasks such as:
a) Image classification
b) Object detection
c) Image segmentation.

Deep Learning:
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing artificial neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to learn complex representations of data.
